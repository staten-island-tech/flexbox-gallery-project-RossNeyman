            <h2>Truss Head</h2>
            <p>The dome shape of the heads of truss screws is low enough to use for most projects, but an advantage is
                 that the screws are difficult to remove or tamper with. Another advantage of a truss screw is that the
                  wide head prevents it from sinking too deeply into the material and causing tearing.</p>
